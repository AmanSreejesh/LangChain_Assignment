"""
This assignment uses AI (specifically the Github Copilot) in the manual coding aspect. For the parts of the assignment that includes structuring the workflow and deciding what programs to call upon (API's, etc) was decided by me. However, for the actual technical implementation, Copilot was used to assist due to the complexity of the issue.
